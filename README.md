In this Challenge we were tasked with building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This challenge features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. Some of these features include: a high-score page accessable through a nav button, dynamic messages and page loading, getting and setting local storage through the browser and a timer that removes time for wrong answers.
